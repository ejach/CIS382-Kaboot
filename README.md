### Project Specification v1.2

#### CIS-382 Database Programming

Design and implement a system for managing multiple-choice tests. Your
system should support:

- addition of new question;
- editing of question;
- and creation of tests from the available set of question.
  User must also be able to:
- take tests;
- and the system should give students feedback on their scores and
  save it in the database.
  There must be a graphical user interface (it must not be a simple console
  application). You could make it a desktop, web or mobile app for example.
- Use PostgreSQL as your DBMS.
- Your project should be hosted on GitHub.
- The database should be at least in the third normal form.
- At least one stored procedure/function must be used.
- At least one trigger must be used not using the function previously mentioned.
- Your application must access the database using the DAO pattern.
- You must also create an E-R diagram of your database.
  This project should be accomplished in groups of three.
  This project should follow code guidelines (see syllabus)
  Important note: More content may be added to this project specification as we progress in our
  classes. If any modification is made to this document, I will inform you by e-mail.

### Heroku Deployment

This requires two Heroku apps, one for the [frontend](https://github.com/ejach/CIS382-Kaboot/blob/main/app/static/README.md) and one for the backend.

1. Create a Heroku app with a PostgreSQL database setup
2. CD into the current working directory and run

```bash
$ heroku container:push web --app <your_app_name>
```

3. Once the image is done pushing run

```bash
$ heroku container:release web --app <your_app_name>
```

4. Add the environment variables to Heroku by navigating to `Settings > Config Vars` and adding the following `Key:Value` pairs for the Database:

```bash
dbname=xxx
password=xxx
host=xxx
user=xxx
```
